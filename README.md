# Covid19 Exploratory Analysis


This project is an exploratory analysis of the COVID-19  dataset retrieved from the Our World in Data website. The dataset contains daily deaths and Vaccinations attributed to COVID-19 by country and date.

In this project, we utilized MySQL to explore the dataset and gain insights into the trends and patterns of COVID-19 . We used various SQL techniques to manipulate, aggregate, and visualize the data, including:

-Data cleaning and preprocessing.
-Querying and filtering data using WHERE and HAVING clauses.
-Grouping and aggregating data using GROUP BY and SUM functions.
-Joining multiple tables to combine data from different sources.
Creating CTE's for visualizations purposes.

In addition to the MySQL analysis, a Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the key insights and findings from the dataset. The dashboard includes interactive charts and tables that allow users to explore the data in more detail.
The SQL code for this project can be found in the "SQL_code" folder of this repository. You can also view the full SQL code in this link [add your link here].

Some of the key findings from this analysis include:
 - The top 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 death tolls.
 - The daily death rate trend of COVID-19 globally.
 - The correlation between COVID-19 deaths and population density.
 - Percent of population infected and vaccinated  by country .
